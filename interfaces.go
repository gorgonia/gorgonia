// Tensor represents values that are acceptable in Gorgonia. At this point, it is implemented by:
//   - tensor.Basic[DT]
//   - exprgraph.Node
//   - *exprgraph.Symbolic
//
// There is an overlap with values.Value. The reason is semantic clarity. Values are Tensors. Tensors are Values.
// There is clearly one issue with this though: *exprgraph.Symbolic.
// *Symbolic is a "fake" tensor, and cannot be lifted as a *dual.Dual.
